=>If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
These 100 songs has the following averages:
average valence (0.48), low speechiness (avg 0.12), not very loud (avg. -5.68),
reasonable energy (0.66), and reasonable denceability (0.72). So if I interpret correctly these results,
I would say that these songs reflects an Yellow Audio Aura because with these types of songs you get focused
to achieve your goals of the day because these songs are energetic, they have more music than words, they are
kind of positive on average but they are not loud.

=>Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative
of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
This is a sample of 100 songs that might reflect the top or bottom 100 songs of the year for the listener but
they may not have the population of songs. With technology, you can process the whole list and a sample is
not needed.
Also, this is beyond my expertise in music analysis but perhaps we can brake down the indexes in 3 ranges: low,
mid-size and high and get a better picture of the numbers to intepret the data and not relying only in total
averages which might include numbers that create distorsions in the means.
