sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: With 50K numbers, with reversed and random files, the program took 5.1 and 5.7 seconds
respectively, but ordered data took 0.384. This shows a case where the numbers are ordered, Bubble sort takes
the minimum number of steps because the file is already sorted.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: With 50K numbers, the 3 type of files took about 0.5 seconds on average.
Merge sort had the lowest O(), meaning O(n log n), while the other sort programs have O(n^2).

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: With 50K numbers, the 3 type of files took about 2.5 seconds on average showing an
O(n^2). Also, the sort program with ordered numbers goes over the whole list of numbers regardless of the file
being sorted already, while Bubble sort doesn't.
